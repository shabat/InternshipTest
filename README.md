# InternshipTest
Internship test for InterLink in **Java** and in **JavaScript**.

### Description
This repository has two branches **js-brand** and **java-branch**. I began to write the code on Java but very quickly realised that my knowledge of java is not sufficient enough to easily write and think in java. So I created **js-branch** to understand what should I write and how should I write it.
